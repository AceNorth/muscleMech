MUSCLE MECH!

This is version ALPHA. The game is feature-complete but with minimal content. The next step is to build out the features that currently exist, incorporate bugfixes from the Alpha playtest, and move into Beta in about a month!

As you play, please email me at muscleMechAlpha@gmail.com with the following:

1) Bugs and crashes
2) Systems that are difficult to understand
3) Feature requests - keep in mind that we may not add these features until much later! But feel free to request stuff that you'd like to see.

Thanks again for playing!

***INSTRUCTIONS***

Welcome to Muscle Mech, the running game!

You play as the Captain of the Guard in New Playerville, one of the first colonies on the newly-discovered planet of ADVENTURIA.

Your goal is to discover the source of the NIGHTMARE INVADERS that plague your colony, and to put a stop to their attacks!

Login by entering your email address (this is only used for authentication - it doesn't have to be your real address) and whatever password you like. Remember what you enter, as this will be your login information.

The main screen shows New Playerville, your current POWER (for upgrading stuff - your earn this by running) and the state of your colony. Angry factions may attack your colony and try to destroy your shields - if they do, you lose.

You may also purchase BASE UPGRADES that unlock new sidequests and missions, and/or guide the future destiny of your colonists.

***AVAILABLE MISSIONS***

The AVAILABLE MISSIONS screen shows all the world events that you're aware of. Click on an enemy army or sidequest to see a list of MISSIONS that you can undertake - you will often have multiple choices about how to address a situation.

New events will pop up every day. Each event only sticks around for a few days, and once their timer runs out there may be conequences you don't want - so make sure to prioritize which events you want to tackle!

***THE MISSION DASHBOARD***

Once you've selected a MISSION, you'll be taken to the MISSION DASHBOARD. Here's how it works!

Once you press START, the app will track your location and update your distance automatically. If you're running on a treadmill, toggle TREADMILL MODE on beforehand and tell it the pace at which you'll be running.

Every MINUTE you run, you generate POWER. You also earn POWER for every quarter mile you run! This is great because you can spend it on stuff!

Every MINUTE you'll ALSO deal damage to your opponent, getting you closer to winning the mission! You deal damage based on your BOOST LEVEL. As you earn power, your BOOST LEVEL will increase and you'll deal more damage!

If you reduce your enemy's health to 0, you win the mission! You can keep running for as long as you like!

If you don't manage to complete the mission, that's ok! You still keep your accumulated power and can attempt the mission again later if you like.

Once you're done running, press "Done". You can alter any of your running stats in case there was an error (but this won't change your points, so it isn't cheating!). Then your run will be saved in your personal RUN DATABASE.

The final screen is...

***THE MECH GARAGE***

Here you can see the stats for your current Mech (the magic suit you wear when you run): 
- its health
- the max power it generates per minute (note that this starts at 1 and increases by 1 per minute, up to the maximum)
- the power you generate per quarter mile
- your boost levels and their associated damage outputs

You can UPGRADE YOUR MECH to increase these stats, for 1000 power * your current level.
